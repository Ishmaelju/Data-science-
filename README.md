Overview

This repository contains multiple data science projects covering web scraping, text analysis, classification, and clustering. Each project includes data preprocessing, visualization, and insights derived from real-world datasets.

Web Scraping

Scraped book data from an online store.
Extracted fields: Title, Genre, Price, Stock, Rating, and URL.
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.
Generated summary statistics and exploratory analysis.
Hollywood Movies Dataset

Data Analysis

Analyzed top-grossing movies to identify trends in the industry.
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and runtime conversion.
Visualization: Created multiple plots to uncover patterns in movie success.
Outlier detection & insights: Identified key factors influencing high revenue.


Text Processing & Sentiment Analysis

Customer Reviews Dataset
Processed customer reviews from Disneyland locations.
Created a sentiment classification system (Positive vs. Negative).
Text cleaning & transformation applied for better model accuracy.
Implemented topic modeling (LDA, NMF, SVD) to extract key themes from reviews.

Machine Learning: Classification & Clustering

Healthcare Dataset (Binary Classification)
Built models to predict stroke occurrences.
Used Random Forest, KNN, and another classifier.
Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Performed hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
Clustering with K-Means
Applied K-Means clustering to uncover hidden patterns in the dataset.
Determined optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
Analyzed how clusters can inform business decisions.
